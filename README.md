# FITNESS AND SPORTS
## PROJECT DESCRIPTION
In today's world, everyone has become health-conscious and is investing time in making themselves fit and healthy. Being physically active can reduce the risk of many diseases, improve our mental health, increase energy levels, and also provide many more benefits. Nowadays, people are showing interest in becoming fitter. Our website 'Fitness Insider' is one of the sources for such people interested in sports and fitness through which they can get freshly brewed content regarding sports and some tips that help in their fitness journey. This website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. The sports updates are displayed using APIs that collect day-to-day highlight updates of sports and display them on the website. Also, fitness tips keep updating to provide the user with the latest information.
So, on this website, we try to promote fitness among people and encourage them to play sports which leads to building a healthy society.
